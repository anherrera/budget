Budget App in Meteor.js
======

This app grew out of two distinct needs: The need to learn something new because working on the same thing all the time gets old, and the need for me to have a budgeting style that works for me. 

I used to get paid every two weeks and my partner used to get paid once a week. Well, I'm sure we all know bills are pretty much monthly, so trying to determine which paycheck pays which bills and how much you'll have left over can get rather annoying. 

Toss out that spreadsheet you've been updating each week. This budget app is alive and will keep up with you. Add income and bills, tag them as debt or savings, ooh and ahh at the pretty graphs and find out if you have enough money to buy those concert tickets when they go on sale in three weeks. It's all possible!

Issues and pull requests COMPLETELY welcome! Let's make this thing awesome.
